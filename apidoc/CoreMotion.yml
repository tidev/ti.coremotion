description: |
    The Core Motion module provides access to Apple's CoreMotion APIs. The Core Motion module provides support
    for monitoring various hardware sensors on iOS devices, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and
    magnetometer. The Core Motion module allows you to access the metrics provided by these sensors.

    For instruction and examples of using the Core Motion Module, see the
    [Core Motion Module guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Core_Motion_Module).


    ### Requirements

    This module only works with devices running iOS 7 and later. Not all devices have the same hardware sensors,
    so all features may not be available for all devices. Be sure to use the API to check the device
    for the existence of a feature.

    You can only test the Core Motion module on a device. The Core Motion API cannot be tested on the iOS
    simulator.

    Some features may require permission to use "Motion Activity". iOS requires the user's approval to
    use the "Motion Activity" permission. When the application uses the Core Motion API for the first
    time, iOS prompts the user to either approve or deny access to the Core Motion features of the
    device. The user can change the permission settings with **Settings** > **Privacy**.


    ### Getting Started

    Once you have [installed](#!/guide/Using_a_Module) the module and added it as a depedency,
    use `require()` to access it from JavaScript:

        var CoreMotion = require("ti.coremotion");

        // The `CoreMotion` variable is a reference to the Module object.  Use this reference to make
        // subsequent calls to the CoreMotion Module API. The following example shows the step counting
        // API of `CoreMotion`.

        var pedometer = CoreMotion.createPedometer();

        // This code checks to see if the device can gather step counting data
        if (pedometer.isStepCountingAvailable()) {
            // If it can, it starts the step counter and outputs the data to the console
            pedometer.startPedometerUpdates(function(e) {
                Ti.API.info(JSON.stringify(e));
            });
        } else {
            Ti.API.warn('This device does not support counting steps.');
        }


    ### Sample Application

    The module ZIP file contains a Core Motion sample applications in `example/app.js`.

        The Z-axis rotation rate in radians per second. The sign
        follows the right hand rule: If the right hand is wrapped
        around the Z axis such that the tip of the thumb points toward
        positive Z, a positive rotation is one toward the tips of the
        other four fingers.

methods:
  - name: multiplyByInverseOfAttitude
    summary: Yields the change in attitude given a specific attitude.
    description: |
        This method multiplies the inverse of the specified <CoreMotionAttitude>
        object by the attitude represented by the receiving object. It replaces
        the receiving instance with the attitude change relative to the object
        passed in attitude. You should cache the <CoreMotionAttitude> instance
        you want to use as a reference and pass that object as the argument to
        subsequent calls of this method.
    parameters:
      - name: attitude
        summary: An object representing the device's attitude at a given moment of measurement.
