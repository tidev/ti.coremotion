name: Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion
platforms: [iphone, ipad]
summary: Allows Titanium client applications to access CoreMotion's DeviceMotion APIs.
since: "5.2.0"
extends: Titanium.Proxy
createable: true
methods:
  - name: setShowsDeviceMovementDisplay
    summary: Controls whether the device-movement display is shown.
    description: |
        When a device requires movement (for example, to calibrate the compass), the value of 
        this property indicates if the system's device-movement display should be shown. 
        When a device requires movement, the callback for 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.setDeviceMotionUpdateInterval> or 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame> reports 
        the <Modules.CoreMotion.ERROR_DEVICE_REQUIRES_MOVEMENT> error once. By default, 
        this is set to false.
    parameters:
      - name: show
        summary: Boolean indicating if the display should be shown
        type: Boolean

  - name: setDeviceMotionUpdateInterval
    summary: The interval in milliseconds, for providing device-motion updates to the callback.
    description: |
        The system supplies device-motion updates to the callback passed to 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame> or
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdates> at regular intervals 
        determined by the value passed to this method. The interval units 
        are in milliseconds. The value of this property is capped to minimum 
        and maximum values; the maximum value is determined by the maximum 
        frequency supported by the hardware. If your app is sensitive to the 
        intervals of device-motion data, it should always check the timestamps 
        of the delivered device-motion event to determine the true update interval.
    parameters:
      - name: interval
        summary: The interval in milliseconds
        type: Number

  - name: startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame
    summary: Starts device-motion updates using a reference frame.
    description: |
        If a callback is passed to this method, it will be called whenever there is an update.
        The frequency of these updates can be controlled using the 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.setDeviceMotionUpdateInterval> method.
        If no callback is passed, the device-motion data can be accessed using the 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.getDeviceMotion> method. To stop the delivery of events, 
        call the <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.stopDeviceMotionUpdates> method.
    parameters:
      - name: args
        summary: The arguments passed to this method
        type: CoreMotionReferenceFrameArgs

      - name: callback
        summary: The method to be called when there is an update.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionDeviceMotionDataWithSuccess>
        optional: true

  - name: startDeviceMotionUpdates
    summary: Starts device-motion updates.

        If a callback is passed to this method, it will be called whenever there is an update.
        The frequency of these updates can be controlled using the 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.setDeviceMotionUpdateInterval> method.
        If no callback is passed, the device-motion data can be accessed using the 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.getDeviceMotion> method. To stop the delivery of events, 
        call the <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.stopDeviceMotionUpdates> method.
    parameters:
      - name: callback
        summary: The method to be called when there is an update.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionDeviceMotionDataWithSuccess>
        optional: true

  - name: stopDeviceMotionUpdates
    summary: Stops device-motion updates.

  - name: getAttitudeReferenceFrame
    summary: |
        Returns either the reference frame currently being used or the default 
        attitude reference frame.
    description: |
        If device motion is active, this property returns the reference frame currently in use. 
        If device motion is not active but has been active since the app was last launched, 
        this property returns the last frame used. If device motion has not been active since 
        the app was last launched, this property returns the default attitude reference frame 
        for the device.
        Possible reference frames include 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.ATTITUDE_REFERENCE_FRAME_X_ARBITRARY_Z_VERTICAL>, 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.ATTITUDE_REFERENCE_FRAME_X_ARBITRARY_CORRECTED_Z_VERTICAL>, 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.ATTITUDE_REFERENCE_FRAME_X_MAGNETIC_NORTH_Z_VERTICAL>, and
        <Modules.CoreMotion.ATTITUDE_REFERENCE_FRAME_X_TRUE_NORTH_Z_VERTICAL>.
    returns:
        type: Number

  - name: availableAttitudeReferenceFrames
    summary: Returns a bitmask specifying the available attitude reference frames on the device.
    description: |
        A bitmask that you can bitwise-AND with the `ATTITUDE_REFERENCE` constants.

        For example to determine if `ATTITUDE_REFERENCE_FRAME_X_MAGNETIC_NORTH_Z_VERTICAL` is available on device.

        ``` javascript
        var frames = CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.availableAttitudeReferenceFrames();
        if (frames & CoreMotion.ATTITUDE_REFERENCE_FRAME_X_MAGNETIC_NORTH_Z_VERTICAL) {
            // do something here
        }
        ```
    returns:
        type: Number

  - name: isDeviceMotionActive
    summary: Returns a Boolean value that determines whether the app is receiving updates from the device-motion service.
    description: |
        Indicates whether <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdates> or 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame> has been called since 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.stopDeviceMotionUpdates>.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: isDeviceMotionAvailable
    summary: Returns a Boolean indicating whether device-motion is available on the device.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: getDeviceMotion
    summary: Returns the latest sample of device-motion data.
    description: |
        An app that is receiving device-motion data after calling 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame> or
        <Modules.CoreMotion.DeviceMotion.startDeviceMotionUpdates> with no callback, need to periodically
        check the value returned by this method and process the device-motion data.
    returns:
        type: CoreMotionDeviceMotionData
