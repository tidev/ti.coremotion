  - name: startPedometerUpdates
    summary: Starts the delivery of recent pedestrian-related data to your app.
    description: |
        Upon calling this method, the pedometer object starts calling your handler block regularly 
        with data. The data passed to your handler block represents the cumulative data starting at the 
        specified start date and ending at the current time. (You can get the start and end dates from 
        the CMPedometerData object passed to your handler.) This method initiates the event delivery 
        process asynchronously and executes your block on a serial dispatch queue, which ensures that 
        only one copy of the block runs at any given time.

        When the app is suspended, the delivery of updates stops temporarily. Upon returning to foreground 
        or background execution, the pedometer object begins updates again.

        To stop the delivery of events, call the <Modules.CoreMotion.Pedometer.stopPedometerUpdates> method.

    parameters:
      - name: args
        summary: An object of arguments
        type: CoreMotionStartPedometerArgs

      - name: callback
        summary: The callback to execute with the results.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionPedometerDataWithSuccess>
    osver: {ios: {min: "8.0"}}

  - name: stopPedometerUpdates
    summary: Stops the delivery of recent pedestrian data updates to your app.
    description: |
        Use this method to stop the delivery of continuous updates that were initiated 
        by a call to the <Modules.CoreMotion.Pedometer.startPedometerUpdates> method.       

  - name: queryPedometerData
    summary: Retrieves the data between the specified start and end dates.
    description: |
        Use this method to retrieve historical pedestrian data between the specified dates. 
        This method runs asynchronously and delivers the data to the block you provide. Only the past 
        seven days worth of data is stored and available for you to retrieve. Specifying a start date 
        that is more than seven days in the past returns only the available data.

        It is safe to call this method at the same time that you are generating continuous updates using the 
        <Modules.CoreMotion.Pedometer.startPedometerUpdates> method.

    parameters:
      - name: args
        summary: An object of arguments
        type: CoreMotionStartPedometerArgs

      - name: callback
        summary: The callback to execute with the results.
        type: Callback<CoreMotionPedometerDataWithSuccess>
    osver: {ios: {min: "8.0"}}
